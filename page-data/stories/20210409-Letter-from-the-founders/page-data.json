We see this shift in mindset as a positive outcome of a period of artificial economic slowdown (i.e. national lockdowns). On an individual level, self-reflection and perspective are most often acquired when isolated from the daily hassles and normal routines. Because 2020 impacted all our lives disrupting our routines and making us feel threatened about our present, it created the perfect conditions for a radical transition: we have started to worry more about the future.</p>\n<p>Hope Labs started off as a project between a few friends with a background in research. Our original intent was simply to collect data, document and observe how the current events affected the way people communicated online. However, after having witnessed how the “hope” of a better future can motivate people to think and act more responsibly, we came to the conclusion that our contribution could make a difference. We felt compelled to take action in order to help people focus on what can be done today for a better tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Today, Hope Labs helps charities and social enterprises to communicate more efficiently and effectively with their communities and online. We achieve this with great energy and in accordance with <a href=\"https://hopelabs.co.uk/values\">our values</a>. As a team, we are working together with our partners to keep building momentum and reaching out to the organisations that we think will benefit from our support and expertise.</p>\n<p>We are only at the beginning of our journey and we are excited to fast-forward to the future with you.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n<p>Marco, Giacomo and Irene</p>","fields":{"slug":"20210409-Letter-from-the-founders"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"20210409-Letter-from-the-founders"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1838718452","3000541721","440568431"]}
