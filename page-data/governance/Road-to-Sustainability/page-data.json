This means operating in ways that, at a minimum, meet fundamental responsibilities in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. Responsible businesses enact the same values and principles wherever they have a presence, and know that good practices in one area do not offset harm in another. By clearly defining and incorporating a set of principles into strategies, policies and procedures, and establishing a culture of integrity, Hope Labs is not only upholding their basic responsibilities to people and planet, but also setting the stage for long-term success.</p>\n<h2>Ten Principles for Sustainable Business</h2>\n<p>The ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact are the derived previous work from prominent international organisations.
