Therefore, it is essential that our behaviours are in line with our Mission, Values, and that we respect the rules of the countries where we operate in.</p>\n<p>To ensure that the we will always make the best possible choice for our business, we have created this Code of Conduct. Its fundamental message is that, acting as a team, we should always do what's best for our colleagues, clients, brand, and the communities we operate in. Without exceptions.</p>\n<h2>Mission and Values</h2>\n<h2>Integrity and Ethics</h2>\n<p>Integrity and Ethics. It’s as simple as it sounds.\nWhenever you’re faced with a decision—big or\nsmall—always do what you know is ethically right,\nand, of course, always follow the law.\nAll teammates are responsible for understanding\nand complying with this Code and all Hope Labs\npolicies as well as the laws, rules and regulations\nof the countries in which we do business together\nwith the terms and conditions of any applicable\nemployment agreement. This Code applies to all\nHope Labs teammates, including those based in\nour U.S. offices, offices around the world, UA retail\nstores, our distribution centers, our Connected\nFitness offices, as well as our subsidiaries and our\nBoard of Directors.\nIf you’re a manager, you have a special responsibility\nto lead and educate your team on this Code and our\nhigh ethical standards. You should also keep an open\ndoor policy and be available to your teammates to\ndiscuss ethical concerns any time. You can refer to\nthe Speak Up Guide for People Leaders for how to\nrespond when an ethical concern is reported.\nOf course, this Code doesn’t cover EVERY ethical\nissue. You should be sensitive to situations and\nactivities and know that if something looks wrong\nand feels wrong, it’s probably wrong. Subject to\napplicable law, Hope Labs will take disciplinary\naction against those who violate our Code, up to and including immediate termination or, in some cases,\nnotification to the relevant authorities.\nThe Global Ethics &#x26; Compliance team is responsible\nfor the general oversight, administration and\ninterpretation of this Code.\nAny waiver of the provisions contained in this Code\nfor an executive officer or director must be approved\nby the Audit Committee and will be promptly\ndisclosed as required by law or regulation. Any\nwaiver for any other teammate, or any representative,\nconsultant or agent to which this Code applies, must\nbe approved by the Global Ethics &#x26; Compliance team.</p>\n<h2>Speak Up</h2>\n<h3>How to Report</h3>\n<p>If you directly see or hear about a situation that may violate our Code of Conduct, Policies and the law, we expect you to speak up. You can do this by getting in touch with one member of the board of your choice or submitting an anonymous message to (compliance@quasiscience.com). No retaliation will be taken against any team member for raising an ethical concern, question or complaint in good faith. All legitimate concerns, questions or complaints will be taken seriously, addressed in a professional and, when possible, confidential manner. After it is determined that a matter needs to be investigated:</p>\n<h3>Non-retaliation</h3>\n<p>No retaliation will be taken against any teammate\nfor raising an ethical concern, question or complaint\nin good faith. Should the identity of the teammate\nmaking the complaint be known, the Global Ethics &#x26;\nCompliance team will monitor any disciplinary action\nagainst the teammate to determine if it is retaliatory.\nIn other words, if you speak up in good faith, you’re\nprotected. </p>\n<h2>Work Environment</h2>\n<h3>Equal Opportunities and Non-Discrimination</h3>\n<p>At Hope Labs, we are committed to an environment that allows each of us as teammates to do our very best work. That means that we are committed to providing an environment of mutual respect where equal employment opportunities are available to all applicants and teammates without regard to race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy\n(including childbirth, lactation and related medical conditions), national origin, age, physical and mental disability, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information (including characteristics and testing), military/veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by local, state or federal law. </p>\n<h3>Workplace Safety</h3>\n<p>Hope Labs is committed to preventing workplace violence and maintaining a safe work environment. We have zero tolerance for workplace violence.</p>\n<h3>Harrassment</h3>\n<p>Hope Labs is committed to a safe, congenial workplace and to that end, we strictly prohibit and will not tolerate harassment of any kind. Harassment can take many forms but includes sexual harassment and unwelcome conduct, threats or bullying, name-calling, negative stereotyping, unwelcome physical contact, offensive gestures or damaging the physical property of others.</p>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>We work to make products that athletes will feel good about wearing. This means we seek to make game-changing products with raw materials and processes that are also better for the planet – our global House. We strive to leave our home field better by responsibly managing energy, water, waste and materials across the value chain. We also seek to work with manufacturing partners that engage in Sustainable Business Practices and align with our values, including to “Think Beyond” and protect the planet for current and future generations. To learn more, please check out the Environment section of the About UA website.</p>\n<h3>Fair Labor Practices</h3>\n<p>Hope Labs is committed to upholding the human rights and dignity of the people who make our products. We believe that all workers - including those of our suppliers - should be treated fairly and respectfully. The supply chain social compliance program component of our Sustainability program has been accredited by the Fair Labor Association (FLA), an independent, globally recognized, nonprofit organization that conducts rigorous monitoring of labor standards in factories. If you have any questions, please check out Hope Labs’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Responsible Sourcing Policy on Our House.</p>\n<h2>Data Privacy</h2>\n<h3>Client</h3>\n<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of our consumers’ personal data everywhere. Hope Labs’s Privacy Policies address our commitment to collecting, storing and using this information. We handle the storage, access and transfer of personal data in accordance with applicable laws. If teammates hear about or suspect any data incidents, immediately contact the Data Incident Response Team.</p>\n<h3>Team Members</h3>\n<p>Hope Labs collects and uses teammates’ personal data as outlined in the Data Privacy Policy for Employees and Employee Candidates. While there may be exceptions in certain countries, you should not have an expectation of privacy when utilizing UA’s systems, computers or other devices. You should also be mindful that the primary purpose of Hope Labs equipment is to conduct business.</p>\n<h2>Protection of Assets</h2>\n<h3>Know-How and Intellectual Property</h3>\n<p>It is important to maintain the confidentiality of\nHope Labs’s non-public business and proprietary\ninformation. This includes any information\nproduced while working for UA and may also\ninclude information about our products, marketing,\ncustomers, teammates (without their authorization),\nvendors, contracts, business strategies, finances,\nmanufacturing, designs, any unpublished data and\nreports and Hope Labs’s intellectual property,\nboth during and after your employment with UA.\nIt is the responsibility of each UA teammate who has\naccess to confidential information to ensure that it\nis used only for authorized purposes. This means\nprotecting it from theft, unauthorized disclosure and\ninappropriate use.\nThere may be cases when there is a legitimate\nbusiness need to disclose confidential Hope Labs\ninformation or when a potential business contact\nneeds to disclose their confidential information to\nHope Labs. In these cases, contact the Legal team\nprior to the disclosure of such information to obtain a\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).\nAny teammate who has a question regarding\nconfidentiality should consult with their manager or\nthe Legal team.</p>\n<h3>Physical Assets</h3>\n<p>Teammates are also responsible for protecting\nHope Labs’s physical assets, which includes\nthings like our physical properties (e.g., stores,\noffices, distribution houses), UA products, UA\npurchased and leased materials (e.g., office supplies,\nfurniture, appliances and equipment). Any teammate\nwho engages in theft, fraud or embezzlement\nwill be subject to disciplinary action, up to and\nincluding termination of employment and/or criminal\nprosecution</p>\n<h2>Media</h2>\n<h3>Social Media</h3>\n<p>When you’re on social media, always remember Under\nArmour’s Global Media Policy, which is located on\nOur House. We encourage teammates to share their\nUA pride on social media, but be thoughtful when\ndoing so. Always keep in mind the risk of sharing\nconfidential company matters and the protection\nof others. Be sure to avoid posting about a new UA\nproduct offering, new UA asset or other sensitive UA\nmarketing information that has not yet been publicly\nannounced. When in doubt…just don’t post. Contact\nthe Human Resources team or refer to the Policy if\nyou have questions. </p>\n<h3>Communications with the Media</h3>\n<p>To make sure Hope Labs communicates with\nthe public in a consistent, timely and professional\nmanner, teammates should speak with their manager\nand the Corporate Communications team before\nresponding to media inquiries or publicly publishing\nanything on behalf of the Brand. Our goal is to put\njust as much thought and effort into teammate media\nrequests and public communication as we put into\nthe creation of our advertising campaigns. Corporate\nCommunications works to safeguard the strength\nof the UA brand and mitigate risk by maintaining a\nconsistent and accurate company message across all\ncommunications.\nUnless explicitly authorized, teammates should not\nrespond to any inquiries from analysts or investors. All\nof those types of communications should be referred\nto Investor Relations. This includes, among other\nthings, posting information on social media, message\nboards, chat rooms, blogs or other online media.\nPlease refer to the Global Media Policy on Our House\nfor additional information regarding interactions with\nmedia through traditional and social channels. If you\nhave any questions, please contact the Corporate\nCommunications team.</p>\n<h2>Gifts</h2>\n<p>Relationships with our business partners are built\non trust, value, quality and service. It’s vital that we\navoid even the appearance that any of our business\ndecisions are based on improper payments, favors,\ngifts or hospitality.\nWe may give or accept gifts to or from Hope Labs\nbusiness partners, but we must be mindful of UA’s gift\nlimit. Gifts include things like products, services, travel\nand entertainment of modest value (less than $100\nin APAC and Mexico and less than $200 elsewhere).\nHowever, teammates may never solicit gifts, gratuities,\nmeals or entertainment. Giving or receiving cash or\ncash equivalents (e.g., gift cards or gift certificates) is\nnot permitted. </p>\n<p>If you receive a gift with a value that exceeds our gift\nlimit, Make the Right Call: • Contact the Global Ethics and Compliance team for\nrecording (globalcompliance@underarmour.com).\n• If the item(s) cannot be returned, they will likely be\ndonated through the Give Back team.\nWhether the gift is returned or donated, you should\nsend a message to the sender referring to UA’s Gift\nPolicy. Sample language: “Regretfully, I must decline\nthe gift. Company policy does not allow teammates to\naccept this type of gift. Your business relationship with\nUA is built on value, trust and quality, not personal gifts.\nI am happy to return it to you, or I can give it to our Give\nBack team to donate to a worthy cause.”\nIt’s your responsibility to ensure that your acceptance\nor giving of gifts is proper and that it can’t be construed as an attempt to grant or gain special advantage.\nSome departments may have more restrictive policies\non accepting gratuities, meals and entertainment.\nAdditionally, different rules apply when dealing with\npublic officials. If you have any doubt or questions\nabout your departmental policy, contact your manager.\nFor more details, check out the Gift Policy posted on\nOur House or contact the Global Ethics &#x26; Compliance\nteam.</p>\n<h2>Record Keeping</h2>\n<h3>Reimbursement of Expenses</h3>\n<p>All business expense transactions incurred by individual members of our team for spends like transportation, hotel, meals and entertainment must be promptly documented, recorded accurately. Subject to applicable law, false or inflated expenses will result in disciplinary action and potentially criminal prosecution, regardless of the date of discovery. Personal expenses and business expenses should always be separated.</p>\n<h3>Accurate Reports and Records</h3>\n<p>We strive for fairness and accuracy in all our records and reports. No member of the team may make any false statements, misleading entries or material omissions in any of Hope Labs' books, financial records, personnel records and systems or other documents or communications.</p>\n<h2>Honest and Fair Dealing</h2>\n<h3>General</h3>\n<p>We must be honest and fair in our business activities with all constituencies (e.g. clients, employees, competitors). Hope Labs is committed to upholding ethical practices.</p>\n<h3>Anti-Trust</h3>\n<h2>Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption</h2>\n<p>Hope Labs is committed to conducting business free from corrupt practices. We must comply with all applicable anti-corruption regulations, such as the UK Bribery Act (2011). This means that no Hope Labs' personnel may offer, accept, pay, promise to pay, or authorise the payment of anything of value to or from a government official or commercial partner in order to gain a business advantage (e.g. winning a new contract or extending an existing one). Excessive gifts, travel, meals or other hospitality expenses, contribution to a political party or campaign and non-vetted charitable contributions might be interpreted as unlawful acts.</p>\n<p>In accordance with Hope Labs' policies, all gifts (given or received) must be reported and approved by the Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>Because Hope Labs is a social enterprise but frequently exchanges products and services with other charities, the vetting process for our charitable donations is particularly strict. To avoid conflicts of interest, Hope Labs, as a company, does not make donations to the charities with which direct business relations exists. Additionally, all team members are required to disclose private charitable contributions. This information will be held in a confidential way.</p>\n<h2>Conflicts of Interests and Corporate Opportunities</h2>\n<p>We expect teammates to avoid any outside interests\nthat might conflict with their loyalty to Hope Labs\nor compromise their judgment. You must not benefit\npersonally from opportunities discovered through the\nuse of Hope Labs’s property or information or your\nposition with Hope Labs, or compete with UA in\nconnection with such opportunities.\nTeammates should avoid any outside employment or\nbusiness or financial interests in another company\nthat interferes with their job performance or their\nability to devote their best efforts to their job. For\nexample, in almost every circumstance, it is a conflict\nof interest for a teammate to work simultaneously for\nHope Labs and a competitor, supplier, or others\nwith which Hope Labs does business.\nTeammates must disclose all outside employment\nor business enterprises in which they are involved\nas well as any financial interests the teammate\nor a member of the teammate’s family has in any\ncompany that competes with or does business with\nUA in accordance with Hope Labs’s Conflicts\nof Interest Policy located on Our House. Generally,\nUA will not do business with an entity in which a\nteammate or member of a teammate’s family has an\neconomic interest, including employment, unless\nthe relationship is disclosed in advance and the\ntransaction is conducted at arm’s length and is\ndeemed to be in the best interest of Hope Labs.\nIf you know or have reason to believe that any actual\nor potential conflict of interest may exist with respect\nto your interests and the interests of the Company,\nyou’re required to disclose the actual or potential\nconflict when it arises, via Hope Labs’s Conflicts\nof Interest portal. In addition, all Director and above\nteammates are required to annually complete UA’s\nConflicts of Interest questionnaire, even if such\nteammates do not have any conflicts of interest.</p>\n<h2>Selection and Use of Third Parties</h2>\n<p>Hope Labs have business partners, including agents, consultants and vendors. All our partners are expected to uphold our high ethical standards. Depending on the type of business partner, various due diligence processes may be applicable (e.g. Legal, Compliance, financial due diligence). Before engaging in with a new partner, the third party needs to be fully vetted.</p>\n<h2>Political Process</h2>\n<p>Hope Labs, as a business, is prohibited from making contributions to political parties, office holders, and political campaigns. </p>\n<p>Team members may participate in the political process as private citizens. However, team members must not use Hope Labs' assets, or their position in the company to promote any personal political cause.</p>","fields":{"slug":"Code-of-Conduct"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"Code-of-Conduct"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1838718452","3000541721","440568431"]}
